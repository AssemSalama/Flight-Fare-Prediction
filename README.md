## 1️⃣ Project Motive :
- Light ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. As data scientists, we are going to prove that given the right data anything can be predicted. Here you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities. Size of training set: 10683 records.


## 2️⃣ Project Structure :
```
A) Train set
⭕EDA : 
         ✅ Departure time
         ✅ Arrival time
         ✅ Duration
⭕ Handling Categorical Data : 
         ✅ Airline
         ✅ Source
         ✅ Destination
         ✅Route , Additional_Info & Total_Stops
⭕ Concatenate dataframes : train_data + Airline + Source +Destination

B) Test Set : apply the same steps as we did above in the `Train set`.
C) Feature Selection
D) Fitting the model using Random Forest Algorithm
E) Hyper Parameter Tuning
```
